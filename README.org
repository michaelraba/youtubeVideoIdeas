* Approach to Making Compelling Videos !
*** Step 1: (Very) Minimalistic Equiptment Requirements
- Lighting: softbox
- Microphone: lav mic etc
- Backdrop with correct lighting. This should add mood and set the video's tone
*** Step 2: Writing a script: Essential Parts and Content
- *Content is king.* In my opinion, this is the most important step. Scripts should be mostly just outlines and the videos /messege/  or story should be authentic/internalized enough so the material flows outward and it takes flight
*** Step 3: Approach and Mindset -- Letting go of perfection
Just create. Good ideas are simple and self-propel.
*** Step 4: Editing it all together with Effective Software
 + *Video Software on Linux* Unfortunately there is no good video editing software for linux. The best bet here seems to be [[https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve][Davinci Resolve for linux]]. This software can be installed on kde/ubuntu with a open source installer -- since Davinci provides for (I think) redhat linux OS only (link). However The linux version of this was lacking capability to do basic functions like adding a voiceover track (see [[https://forum.blackmagicdesign.com/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=92281][this forum]]). Such a missing basic functionality means this is not a good option, as Resolve's linux build does not seem to be up to par to the mac's, and no other linux video editing software stands out as a possibility. Hence, for video editing, mac still seems to be the best bet.

   + *Hackintosh Idea.* Buying a beefy mac with video editing specs is prohibitivly expensive, so I would like to explore, is possible to install the mac OS onto certain computers? eg [[https://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/f2t7wb/catalina_on_my_dell_precision_7820_with_opencore/][OS X Cataline on this Dell]]
