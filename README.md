# Approach to making Compelling videos


### Step 1: (Very) Minimalistic Equiptment Requirements

-   Lighting: softbox
-   Microphone: lav mic etc
-   Backdrop with correct lighting. This should add mood and set the video&rsquo;s tone


### Step 2: Writing a script: Essential Parts and Content

-   **Content is king.** In my opinion, this is the most important step. Scripts should be mostly just outlines and your &rsquo;message&rsquo; should be authentic/internalized enough so the material flows outward and it takes flight


### Step 3: Approach: Letting go of perfection

Just create. Good ideas are simple and self-propel.


### Step 4: Editing it all together Software
